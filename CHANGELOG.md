All notable changes to the seb-personas plugin are recorded here. Dates are
ISO (YYYY-MM-DD).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-09

Behavioral-drift hardening, prompted by an audit of which shared-protocol
rules were mechanically enforced vs. instruction-only, reviewed and
reprioritized by a second model pass.

### Added
- `templates/protocol-digest.md`: a short (~15-line) reminder of the
  highest-drift-risk rules (explorer routing, review ownership, the 2-FAIL
  cap, WIP sentinel legitimacy, the memory-grant caveat). `setup-personas`
  copies it to `.claude/protocol-digest.md`, version-stamped like
  `persona-protocol.md`, but does NOT import it into CLAUDE.md.
- `session-start.sh` now re-injects that digest via `additionalContext`, but
  only when the hook's `source` field is `resume` or `compact` — never
  `startup`/`clear`, where the full protocol is already freshly in context.
  This targets the exact moments a long-running session (the orchestrator's
  uncapped main session especially) is most likely to have summarized the
  protocol away. Mechanical timing of when the rules reappear, not more
  static prose to hope survives compaction.
- `hooks/scripts/reviewer-route-gate.sh`: a `PreToolUse` hook (matcher
  `Agent`) mechanically blocking lead-programmer from spawning the reviewer
  directly, closing the payload-attribution question this same section
  previously deferred (see below). Confirmed empirically, not assumed: a
  nested `Agent`-tool call's `PreToolUse` payload carries the calling
  subagent's `agent_type`/`agent_id` alongside the call's own
  `tool_input.subagent_type`, the same attribution `stop-gate.sh` already
  relies on for `SubagentStop`. Registered in `hooks.json` alongside
  `protected-paths.sh`. Only covers a direct `Agent`-tool spawn attempt, not
  `SendMessage` to an existing reviewer teammate in agent-teams mode — a
  different tool with a different payload shape, out of scope here.

### Changed
- `lead-programmer.md`: `tdd` and `diagnose` moved out of the `skills:`
  frontmatter (which preloads a skill's full body into every spawn
  regardless of whether the task needs it) and are now invoked on demand via
  the `Skill` tool instead — the body's "TDD-first" bullet is the trigger.
  `coding-discipline` stays preloaded (small, applies to every task). This
  was the largest identified per-spawn token cost on the system's
  highest-frequency persona; a one-line fix doesn't need the full TDD/diagnose
  choreography resident before it's asked for. The review-ownership bullet is
  now one sentence instead of six lines, since `reviewer-route-gate.sh` (see
  Added) backs it mechanically instead of by instruction alone. A
  maintainer-facing comment explaining the old `skills:`/`tools:` rationale
  was cut from the body (see this entry instead) now that the rationale it
  described no longer applies. Added a short "keep memory bounded" bullet
  (index file + topic files + periodic pruning) since `memory: project` notes
  otherwise accumulate with nothing pruning them.
- `setup-personas` step 3's placeholder-substitution instructions updated:
  `lead-programmer.md`'s `<MATTPOCOCK:tdd>`/`<MATTPOCOCK:diagnose>`
  placeholders now live in its body prose instead of its `skills:`
  frontmatter (per the change above); `planner.md`/`repo-historian.md` are
  unaffected. Step 10's hook-verification list gained a
  `reviewer-route-gate.sh` dry-run check matching the pattern used for the
  other hooks.
- The WIP sentinel (`.claude/wip-handoff.<agent-id>`) now requires non-empty
  content. A bare `touch` used to bypass the stop-gate silently and
  invisibly; `stop-gate.sh` now rejects empty sentinels (deletes but doesn't
  honor them, falling through to the normal check) and logs the stated
  reason plus a timestamp to `.claude/wip-audit.log` before honoring a valid
  one. Closes a silent escape hatch from the system's one blocking gate.
  `.claude/wip-audit.log` is gitignored by `setup-personas` like the other
  runtime-only files.

### Confirmed unchanged / deliberately deferred
- The payload-attribution probe from this section's earlier draft is
  resolved (see `reviewer-route-gate.sh` under Added) — `PreToolUse` does
  carry caller `agent_type`. That unblocks a spawn-matrix hook for review
  ownership (shipped) but a per-persona write-path allowlist is a separate,
  larger follow-up not attempted here.
- The 2-FAIL cap stays instruction-only in subagent-orchestrator mode for
  now; the proposed fix (reviewer writes a `.fail` marker mirroring the
  existing PASS-marker pattern) needs a stable per-unit key that
  subagent-orchestrator mode doesn't currently have.
- No `maxTurns` cap was added to `lead-programmer` yet, despite being the
  other uncapped, long-running persona alongside the orchestrator.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed
- The orchestrator relayed the planner's "Open Questions" as plain
  conversational text with no structured mechanism, even though it runs as
  the main session (not a subagent) and can actually use `AskUserQuestion`.
  Confirmed via docs that subagents (including the planner itself) can never
  use `AskUserQuestion` regardless of tools list — this was the correct
  place to wire it in, and wasn't. Added `AskUserQuestion` to
  `orchestrator.md`'s tools and updated its relay instruction to use it for
  questions that reduce to discrete choices.

### Confirmed unchanged (a deliberate choice, not an oversight)
- `planner.md`'s grill-me trigger stays gated on "for any non-trivial task"
  rather than becoming unconditional — the orchestrator's routing table
  already filters out trivial work before it reaches the planner, so the
  gate is mostly redundant in practice but intentionally left as a second
  line of defense.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-04

Bug fixes plus a modularity/update-mechanism rebuild, prompted by a
follow-up review that read the shipped files fresh and asked two questions:
how to make the system more modular, and what's still missing.

### Fixed
- `task-gate.sh` never checked for `.claude/persona-config.json` and nothing
  ever created `.claude/reviewed/`, so the reviewer's PASS-marker `touch`
  would fail on the very first agent-teams completion. Now guarded on config
  presence, and `setup-personas` pre-creates the directory.
- `protected-paths.sh` case-matched project-root-relative glob patterns
  against typically-absolute file paths, so directory-anchored patterns
  (e.g. `supabase/migrations/*`) never matched anything. Paths are now
  normalized against `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` before matching.
- `graph-update.sh` and `lint-on-edit.sh` interpolated the (untrusted) edited
  file path into a string passed to `eval`, allowing command injection via a
  crafted filename. Both now pass the file path as a positional parameter to
  `bash -c` instead.
- All five hook scripts assumed the working directory was the project root;
  they now anchor to `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}` explicitly.
- `agent_id`/`task_id` values from hook JSON payloads are now sanitized
  before being used to build filesystem paths.
- `stop-gate.sh`'s `SubagentStop` scoping moved from a hardcoded
  `lead-programmer` matcher in `hooks.json` to a config-driven `gatedAgents`
  list in `persona-config.json` (confirmed empirically that the
  `SubagentStop` payload carries `agent_type`), so adding a future
  code-writing persona is a config edit, not a plugin file edit.
- `stop-gate.sh` now also checks whether `HEAD` moved since the session's
  baseline commit (recorded by the new `session-start.sh`), closing a gap
  where a lead-programmer that commits per-step (clean tree at handoff) would
  otherwise never actually trigger the check.
- `planner.md`, `lead-programmer.md`, and `reviewer.md` were missing `Skill`
  in their tools list, so they silently lost their preloaded skills
  (grill-me/to-issues, tdd/diagnose/coding-discipline, coding-discipline
  respectively) when run as agent-teams teammates. `repo-historian.md` had
  the same gap and is fixed too.

### Added
- Persona opt-out: `orchestrator`, `explorer`, `lead-programmer` are the
  minimum viable loop; `planner`, `repo-historian`, `reviewer`, `researcher`
  are now selected per-project by `setup-personas`' persona-selection wizard.
  Cross-references to optional personas are phrased conditionally throughout
  so skipping one degrades gracefully instead of hard-erroring. Skipping
  `reviewer` requires an explicit typed confirmation.
- Version-stamp comments on every ADAPT-copied file, plus a `--update` mode
  in `setup-personas` that re-syncs an already-adapted project against a
  newer plugin version — diffing before overwriting, never silently
  clobbering a local edit.
- A `SessionStart` hook (`session-start.sh`) that warns when a project's
  stamped plugin version is behind the installed plugin's current version.
- A 2-FAIL cap on the reviewer FAIL→fix→re-review loop — the orchestrator
  escalates to the user instead of re-delegating a third time.
- `maxTurns: 30` on `planner.md` and `reviewer.md` (the two Opus-tier
  personas), matching the cost-bounding pattern already used by
  `explorer.md`'s `maxTurns: 10`.
- `tests/validate.sh` + a GitHub Actions workflow validating the plugin's own
  files (bash syntax, JSON validity, agent frontmatter, cross-reference
  consistency).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` and a bug-report issue template.
- README sections: removing/uninstalling, adding your own persona, and a
  cost-guidance paragraph.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-03

Initial release. Six-persona system (orchestrator + explorer/planner/
lead-programmer/repo-historian/reviewer as plugin agents, researcher as a
project-scoped template), coding-discipline skill, enforcement hooks, and the
setup-personas ADAPT skill. Built through two adversarial-critique passes and
one empirical smoke test confirming plugin agents are namespaced and the
mandatory agent-copy fix this required.
