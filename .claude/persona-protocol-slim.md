<!-- Copied into the project as .claude/persona-protocol-slim.md by
     install-antislop / `--update`, version-stamped like persona-protocol.md.
     Delivered to lightweight, stateless personas (explorer, researcher,
     scribe) in place of the full persona-protocol.md — it carries only the
     sections that apply to a persona with no review-ownership role in the
     pipeline. Full-tier personas (orchestrator, spec-master, task-master,
     lead-programmer, reviewer, milestone-auditor) still receive the full
     persona-protocol.md; this is not a replacement for it there. Role-
     agnostic content only — adding a new slim persona never requires
     editing this file. -->

# Shared persona protocol (slim)

## Structural questions go to the explorer
Any question about where something is defined, what calls it, blast radius of
a change, inheritance chains, or test coverage: spawn `explorer`, don't invoke
the code-review-graph skill directly. Note this is instruction-enforced for
most personas, not mechanically blocked: `Skill` is in their `tools:` list so
a teammate copy can reach its OWN preloaded skills (which don't apply to
teammates otherwise) — that same tool would technically let them invoke
code-review-graph too. If the explorer reports the graph index is missing or
stale, treat its answer as grep-derived, not authoritative.

**Name-collision warning:** Claude Code's built-in `Explore` subagent shadows
this project's `explorer` under description-based auto-delegation, and it has
no graph MCP access. Always spawn by explicit name (`explorer`,
`.claude/agents/explorer.md`). If an answer lacks graph provenance (symbol →
file:line) and you didn't expect the grep fallback, assume the built-in ran
and re-spawn by name.

## Answer shape
When you return findings (to the orchestrator, another persona, or the user):
lead with the direct answer, then compact supporting facts. Never dump raw
tool output, full file contents, or whole diffs verbatim — distill it. This
applies doubly to the explorer, whose entire purpose is keeping noisy
traversal out of the caller's context.

## Scope Bash output before it enters context
Don't let a verbose command dump its full, untruncated output into your own
context — that cost is paid whether or not you go on to distill it for
someone else. Before running a command that can plausibly return more than a
screenful (build logs, full-repo greps, directory listings, verbose test
runs), pipe it through `head`/`tail`/`wc -l`/a targeted `grep` first, or pass
the tool's own quiet/summary flag if it has one. If you need to inspect a
large result in full after a summary looked interesting, fetch the narrower
slice you actually need rather than re-running the same command unfiltered.

## Agent-teams mode (only relevant if you were spawned as a teammate)
- Your `skills:` and `mcpServers:` frontmatter fields are NOT applied when
  you run as a teammate. If you need a preloaded skill (e.g. explorer needs
  code-review-graph), invoke it explicitly via the `Skill` tool if it's in
  your tools list; otherwise ask the explorer teammate via `SendMessage`.
- You CAN still spawn ordinary foreground subagents as a teammate (e.g. the
  explorer) — the restriction is on nested TEAMS, not on subagent spawning in
  general. Don't fall back to Grep/Glob out of a mistaken belief that
  spawning is unavailable; only fall back if no explorer teammate exists and
  spawning genuinely isn't warranted for a one-off lookup.
- Delivery to teammates via SendMessage is asynchronous; a spawned subagent
  call is synchronous and pauses you until it returns. Choose based on
  whether you need the answer before continuing.
- On finishing a unit of work, push your report to the team lead via
  `SendMessage` rather than relying on `idle_notification` or plain turn-text
  output — the lead has no channel to receive either of those. Address it to
  whichever name/identifier the lead used when it spawned you; don't assume a
  fixed literal like `"main"` is always correct, since the right recipient
  can differ between agent-teams mode and other modes.

## A note on `memory`
If your persona has a `memory` field set, Claude Code auto-grants you Read,
Write, and Edit so you can manage your memory files — this happens regardless
of your declared `tools:` list. That is not license to edit source code if
your role says you never do. The restriction in that case is enforced by
instruction, not by the tool allowlist — treat it as a hard rule anyway.
