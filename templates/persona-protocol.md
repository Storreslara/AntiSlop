# Shared persona protocol

## Structural questions go to the explorer
Any question about where something is defined, what calls it, blast radius of
a change, inheritance chains, or test coverage: spawn `explorer`, don't invoke
the code-review-graph skill directly. Note this is instruction-enforced for
most personas, not mechanically blocked: `Skill` is in their `tools:` list so
a teammate copy can reach its OWN preloaded skills (which don't apply to
teammates otherwise) — that same tool would technically let them invoke
code-review-graph too. Only the orchestrator has no `Skill` tool at all,
making its isolation mechanical; everyone else's is this rule. If the
explorer reports the graph index is missing or stale, treat its answer as
grep-derived, not authoritative.

**Name-collision warning:** Claude Code's built-in `Explore` subagent shadows
this project's `explorer` under description-based auto-delegation, and it has
no graph MCP access. Always spawn by explicit name (`explorer`,
`.claude/agents/explorer.md`). If an answer lacks graph provenance (symbol →
file:line) and you didn't expect the grep fallback, assume the built-in ran
and re-spawn by name.

## Answer shape
When you return findings (to the orchestrator, another persona, or the user):
lead with the direct answer, then compact supporting facts. Never dump raw
tool output, full file contents, or whole diffs verbatim — distill it. This
applies doubly to the explorer, whose entire purpose is keeping noisy
traversal out of the caller's context.

## Scope Bash output before it enters context
Don't let a verbose command dump its full, untruncated output into your own
context — that cost is paid whether or not you go on to distill it for
someone else. Before running a command that can plausibly return more than a
screenful (build logs, full-repo greps, directory listings, verbose test
runs), pipe it through `head`/`tail`/`wc -l`/a targeted `grep` first, or pass
the tool's own quiet/summary flag if it has one. If you need to inspect a
large result in full after a summary looked interesting, fetch the narrower
slice you actually need rather than re-running the same command unfiltered.

## Agent-teams mode (only relevant if you were spawned as a teammate)
- Your `skills:` and `mcpServers:` frontmatter fields are NOT applied when
  you run as a teammate. If you need a preloaded skill (e.g. explorer needs
  code-review-graph), invoke it explicitly via the `Skill` tool if it's in
  your tools list; otherwise ask the explorer teammate via `SendMessage`.
- You CAN still spawn ordinary foreground subagents as a teammate (e.g. the
  explorer) — the restriction is on nested TEAMS, not on subagent spawning in
  general. Don't fall back to Grep/Glob out of a mistaken belief that
  spawning is unavailable; only fall back if no explorer teammate exists and
  spawning genuinely isn't warranted for a one-off lookup.
- Delivery to teammates via SendMessage is asynchronous; a spawned subagent
  call is synchronous and pauses you until it returns. Choose based on
  whether you need the answer before continuing.
- On finishing a unit of work, push your report to the team lead via
  `SendMessage` rather than relying on `idle_notification` or plain turn-text
  output — the lead has no channel to receive either of those. Address it to
  whichever name/identifier the lead used when it spawned you; don't assume a
  fixed literal like `"main"` is always correct, since the right recipient
  can differ between agent-teams mode and other modes.

## WIP sentinel (mid-task handoff, not a bypass)
To end your turn with work genuinely in progress or a red suite you haven't
finished fixing (TDD red phase, a blocked report, a "the plan is wrong"
escalation): write your reason INTO the sentinel file — e.g.
`echo "TDD red phase, 3 tests intentionally failing" > .claude/wip-handoff.<your-agent-id>`
— and state it in your report too. A bare `touch` no longer works: the
stop-gate hook now requires non-empty content, logs it (with a timestamp) to
`.claude/wip-audit.log`, deletes your sentinel, and allows that one turn to
end. An empty sentinel is deleted but NOT honored — the normal check runs
anyway. This is for legitimate pauses only — never write a reason just to
dodge a red suite you could otherwise fix; the audit log exists precisely so
that use is reviewable after the fact. (Claude Code force-ends a turn after 8
consecutive Stop-hook blocks regardless; the sentinel is the designed exit,
not a workaround for that cap.)

## Running acceptance-criteria commands (there is no self-wake)
Run acceptance-criteria commands — test suites, build/lint checks, anything
gating a verdict or a ready-for-review — synchronously in the foreground via
the `Bash` tool's `timeout` parameter, set as high as needed up to its
600000 ms (10 min) ceiling. Never hand one to `run_in_background: true` and
end your turn assuming you'll be notified when it finishes; this ban is
scoped specifically to acceptance-criteria commands, not backgrounding in
general. Only a *dispatching* session's own `Agent`-tool calls get an
autonomous wake-up when a subagent's turn ends. A subagent's own nested
background `Bash` job has no such mechanism — it goes dormant at
`SubagentStop` until the dispatcher explicitly resumes it, no matter how the
job itself turns out.

If a command genuinely cannot finish within the 600000 ms ceiling, the only
legitimate way to end your turn is the WIP sentinel described above, with a
reason string that plainly states there is "no autonomous wake-up available —
requires the dispatcher to resume me later." Never phrase it as "I'll get
notified" or "I'll poll again shortly" — that implies a self-wake mechanism
that does not exist.

## Retrieval contract
`task-master`'s dispatch instructions state, verbatim, where issues live and
how to fetch them (matching whatever issue tracker was chosen during setup).
Follow that line exactly — never assume a tracker or fetch method.

## Machine-checkable criteria
An acceptance criterion is only valid if it's something an agent can RUN and
get a pass/fail from: a test command, a build/lint exit code, a specific
assertion. "Works correctly" is not a criterion. If a step in a plan has no
runnable check, that's a defect in the plan — say so rather than inventing a
prose substitute.

## Review ownership — one unit, one review, single owner
The lead-programmer never spawns or messages the reviewer directly; only the
orchestrator (subagent-orchestrator mode) or the team lead (agent-teams mode)
routes to the reviewer. "Done" means the reviewer returned PASS — not that the
work looks finished. On FAIL, defects route back to the lead-programmer,
which fixes the specific items listed and reports ready-for-review again; it
never re-plans and never grades its own work.

The reviewer writes the v2 PASS marker at `.claude/reviewed/<task-id>.pass`
in BOTH modes, not only where a `TaskCompleted` hook exists to check it — a
marker that exists only in one mode would be an audit gap. Marker format v2:
the file must be non-empty and its first line must read exactly `PASS
<task-id> <UTC ISO-8601 timestamp> criteria: <acceptance-criteria
command(s) run>`. The reviewer writes this via `Bash` (`printf`, not a bare
`touch`) on a PASS verdict — this is bookkeeping, not fixing code, and does
not conflict with "the reviewer never edits the code under review."
Planning/research/documentation work is never gated by this marker.

In agent-teams mode, "done" is additionally enforced mechanically: the
`TaskCompleted` hook blocks a task from being marked complete unless this
*valid* marker exists at that task's `.pass` path — existence alone is not
enough; an empty or malformed marker is rejected by `task-gate.sh`, and an
accepted marker is additionally logged to `.claude/review-audit.log`
(sibling of `wip-audit.log`). Only tasks named with an `impl:` prefix are
gated by it. In default (subagent-orchestrator) mode, where no
`TaskCompleted` event exists, the equivalent mechanical enforcement is the
pending-review gate (`stop-gate.sh` / `reviewer-route-gate.sh`): turn-end and
the next implementation dispatch are blocked while a completed unit awaits
review.

**Until 2026-07-27** (legacy-marker grace period), `task-gate.sh` warns-and-
allows a legacy/empty/malformed marker instead of blocking, logging
`legacy-marker-grace-period-warning`; after that, unconditional rejection.

## Pending-review flag (default-mode review backstop)
In default (subagent-orchestrator) mode there is no `TaskCompleted` event, so
`stop-gate.sh` carries its own mechanical backstop: whenever a gated agent
(default `lead-programmer`) has a `SubagentStop` that is NOT honored by a WIP
sentinel, it writes `.claude/.pending-review.<agent-id>` — a completed unit,
no reviewer run yet. The reviewer's own `SubagentStop` clears every such flag
(PASS or FAIL) and logs `cleared-by=reviewer` to `.claude/review-audit.log`.
While any flag exists: the main-session `Stop` hook blocks turn-end (exit 2,
"a completed unit is awaiting review"), and `reviewer-route-gate.sh` blocks
dispatching the next gated-agent unit — the orchestrator's correct next move
(spawn the reviewer, or spawn anything non-gated like `explorer`) is never
blocked. Escape hatch, mirroring the WIP sentinel: overwrite the flag's
content with `defer: <reason>` (logged, flag KEPT, that one Stop allowed —
review still owed next turn) or `skip: <reason>` (logged, flag DELETED, unit
explicitly abandoned); a reason-less overwrite is rejected the same way an
empty WIP sentinel is.

## FAIL record (durable warning for future spawns)
On every FAIL verdict, the reviewer also writes `.claude/reviewed/<task-id>.fail`
(both modes) — first line exactly `FAIL <task-id> <UTC ISO-8601 timestamp>`,
followed by the defect list from the verdict, verbatim. This is a bookkeeping
exception, same as the PASS marker — not a change to the code under review.
No hook gate depends on it (the pending-review flag already clears on any
reviewer `SubagentStop`, PASS or FAIL alike); it exists purely so a
completely fresh `spec-master` or orchestrator spawn — one with no memory of
this session at all — still sees that a unit already failed once.

## Continuing after a FAIL verdict
Subagent invocations are one-shot — a fresh lead-programmer call has no
memory of what it just built. When re-delegating after a FAIL: prefer
resuming the same lead-programmer session if the harness supports session
resume for the persona that reported ready-for-review; otherwise bundle a
self-contained prompt with the original plan step, a one-line diff summary
(from `git log`/`git diff` on the relevant commits), and the defect list
verbatim. Don't rely on `memory: project` alone to bridge this gap — memory
is for durable conventions, not the live state of an in-progress fix; the
`.fail` record above is what bridges it for a session with no memory at all.

**Cap at 2 FAILs per unit.** If the same unit FAILs a second time, the
orchestrator (or team lead) stops re-dispatching `lead-programmer` — it
surfaces the full defect history across both attempts to the user, then
spawns `spec-master` to produce a debug spec (a focused root-cause diagnosis
plus revised acceptance criteria for the failed step(s), never a
from-scratch replan), which flows back through `task-master` for
re-dispatch. A unit that fails twice usually means the plan itself has a
gap, not that one more automated pass will close it.

## A note on `memory`
If your persona has a `memory` field set, Claude Code auto-grants you Read,
Write, and Edit so you can manage your memory files — this happens regardless
of your declared `tools:` list. That is not license to edit source code if
your role says you never do (e.g. spec-master and task-master never write
production code, pseudo-code aside). The restriction in that case is enforced
by instruction, not by the tool allowlist — treat it as a hard rule anyway.
